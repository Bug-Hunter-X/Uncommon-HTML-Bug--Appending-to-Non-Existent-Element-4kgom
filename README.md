# Uncommon HTML Bug: Appending to Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML that can be easily overlooked. The bug involves attempting to append content to an element using `innerHTML` when the element itself doesn't exist in the DOM yet.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in the following line of JavaScript code:

`document.getElementById('myDiv').innerHTML += "<p>This text should append.</p>";`

This line of code tries to append new content to an element with the ID 'myDiv'. However, if the element with that ID is not found in the DOM (meaning it hasn't been parsed yet), then the addition won't work without throwing an error.

## Solution
The best way to approach this is always to make sure the element is in the DOM before doing any operations. This can be done in a few ways:
1. Making sure the script runs after the page has been fully loaded. This can be done by using the `DOMContentLoaded` event:
2. If there is additional logic, make sure the element exists before attempting to update it.

This ensures that the element exists in the DOM before attempting to modify it.  The addition of an error handler also provides better robustness to the code.
